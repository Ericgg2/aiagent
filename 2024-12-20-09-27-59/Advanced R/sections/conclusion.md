This paper presents the Advanced Reasoning and Trans-
formation Engine for Multi-Step Insight Synthesis
in Data Analytics (ARTEMIS-DA) , a groundbreak-
ing framework that extends the analytical capabilitiesof Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle complex,
multi-step, data-driven queries with minimal user inter-
vention. By integrating the Planner ,Coder , and Gra-
pher components, ARTEMIS-DA seamlessly combines
high-level reasoning, real-time code generation, and vi-
sual analysis to orchestrate sophisticated analytics work-
flows encompassing data transformation, predictive mod-
eling, and visualization.
Our evaluations highlight ARTEMIS-DA’s state-of-the-
art performance on benchmarks such as TabFact[3],
WikiTableQuestions[17], and FeTaQA[13], demonstrat-
ing its effectiveness in managing nuanced, multi-step an-
alytical tasks. By decomposing natural language queries
into logical tasks, executing precise code for each step and
performing visual analysis of generated graphs, the frame-
work bridges the gap between intuitive user interactions
and advanced computational execution.
ARTEMIS-DA empowers both technical and non-
technical users by simplifying precise analysis of complex
datasets. Future directions include enhancing the frame-
work’s adaptability to broader tasks, improving its com-
putational efficiency, and exploring its application in do-
mains such as software engineering, where rapid and ac-
curate multi-step analysis is essential.

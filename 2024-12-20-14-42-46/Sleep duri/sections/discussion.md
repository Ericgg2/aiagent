Principal
Findings
Research
on
sleep
conducted
during
the
pandemic
primarily
focuses
on
the
direct
disruption
effect
of
lockdowns
on
sleep.
However,
little
is
known
about
the
changes
in
sleep
during
the
late
stage
of
the
pandemic
when
the
restrictive
policies
were
relaxed.
Doing
so
requires
a
more
holistic
view
of
the
other
factors
that
have
been
known
to
affect
sleep
apart
from
the
restriction
policies,
such
as
individual
demographics
or
seasonal
factors.
In
this
study,
we
used
longitudinal
data
from
112
working
adults
over
one
year
to
explore
the
relationship
between
the
over-time
change
in
sleep
and
multiple
factors
(restriction
policies,
seasons,
physical
activity,
sociodemographics).
Our
findings
not
only
reaffirm
several
known
influences
on
sleep
patterns
such
as
gender
and
age,but
they
also
highlight
the
significant
role
of
external
factors
like
restriction
policies
and
seasonal
changes.
It
also
provides
new
findings
on
the
implication
of
a
relaxed
work
schedule
and
its
effects
on
sleep
patterns
among
different
occupations
and
snoozers.
Demographic
factors
Past
research
indicated
various
epidemiological
factors
affecting
sleep
patterns,
most
notably
age,
gender,
and
chronotype.
In
line
with
previous
studies,
we
also
find
an
association
between
age
and
sleep
in
which
older
people
tend
to
sleep
less
[15,
16].
However,
we
discover
a
correlation
between
older
age
and
higher
TST
variability,
contradicting
prior

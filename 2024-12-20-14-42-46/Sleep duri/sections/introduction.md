Sleep
is
a
crucial
component
of
our
daily
lives,
tightly
interconnected
with
all
aspects
of
daily
routines
and
our
overall
well-being,
such
as
mental
health
[44,
45],
physical
health
[58],
and
work
performance
[57,
55].
The
COVID-19
pandemic
had
a
deep
impact
on
various
aspects
of
peopleâ€™s
daily
lives,
with
one
particularly
significant
area
being
sleep
patterns.
However,
the
pandemic's
effects
on
sleep
were
often
indirect,
arising
from
changes
in
daily
routines
and
lifestyle
adjustments,
rather
than
as
a
direct
consequence
of
the
virus.
As
a
response
to
the
pandemic,
outdoor
restrictions
limited
our
exposure
to
natural
daylight,
a
crucial
element
known
to
regulate
our
circadian
rhythms
and
sleep
patterns
[39].
Similarly,
mobility
restrictions
altered
the
structure
of
daily
physical
activity
(PA).
Additionally,
workplace
restrictions
resulted
in
work-from-home
policies,
which
led
to
reduced
mobility
and
flexible
working
hours.
While
all
of
this
led
to
more
relaxed
work
schedules,
it
also
blurred
the
boundaries
between
professional
and
personal
life.
Notably,
all
these
factors
-
daylight
exposure,
physical
activity,
and
work
routine
-
all
significantly
affected
by
the
pandemic,
are
well-established
influences
on
sleep
health
[53,
65].
Therefore,
a
comprehensive
view
of
sleep,
accounting
for
all
these
variables
in
the
context
of
the
pandemic,
is
essential
to
fully
comprehend
the
extent
and
nature
of
its
impact.
Sleep
measurements
traditionally
rely
on
self-reported
methods,
such
as
the
Karolinska
[36]
or
the
Pittsburgh
sleep
diary
[35].
While
those
methods
are
suitable
for
tracking
day-to-day
sleep
over
a
few
days
or
several
weeks,
conducting
diary
studies
over
longer
time
intervals
is
usually
not
favorable
due
to
the
cognitive
burden
on
the
participants.
Non-intrusive
measurements
using
smartphones
and
fitness
trackers
have
recently
emerged
as
a
more
viable
alternative
for
capturing
sleep
over
extended
periods.
While
the
consumer-grade
devices
remain
incapable
of
precisely
detecting
sleep
stages,
for
sleep
onset,
duration,
and
wake-up
time,
these
devices
have
shown
more
promising
results.
Assessment
of
sleep
through
these
devices
has
the
advantage
of
measuringsleep
in
people's
natural
living
environments
as
opposed
to
sleep
laboratories
and
is
not
affected
by
memory
biases,
which
can
occur
with
survey
responses
and
sleep
diaries.
Prior
studies
have
shown
that
wearable
devices
have
proven
to
be
valuable
tools
for
measuring
sleep
patterns
in
various
use
cases.
For
instance,
they
have
been
utilized
to
determine
people's
chronotypes
and
track
their
sleep
and
activity
rhythms
over
extended
periods
[43,
47].
These
devices
have
also
been
employed
to
measure
sleep

information
in
a
baseline
questionnaire,
including
age,
gender,
chronotype,
occupation,
and
origin,
among
others.
Chronotype
was
measured
using
the
reduced
Morningness-Eveningness
Questionnaire
(MEQ)
[30],
with
a
higher
score
indicating
morning
type
and
a
lower
score
indicating
evening
type.
For
the
origin-related
question,participants
were
given
three
choices:
Finland,
Europe
(except
Finland),
or
outside
of
Europe.
We
refer
to
those
who
indicated
they
are
from
Finland
as
Finnish
and
others
as
”migrant
background”.
For
questions
concerning
occupation,
the
participants
were
asked
whether
they
were
academic
or
service
staff.
The
term
"academic
staff"
represents
individuals
involved
in
academic
and
research
activities
within
the
organization.
On
the
other
hand,
"service
staff"
refers
to
individuals
in
roles
such
as
human
resources,
and
other
administrative
or
support
functions.
Snoozing
behavior
was
assessed
using
the
following
question:
“Snoozing
can
be
considered
as
choosing
to
go
back
to
sleep
after
an
alarm
has
awakened
you
intending
to
wake
up
later;
setting
an
alarm
earlier
than
when
you
intend
to
wake
up;
or
setting
multiple
alarms
with
the
intent
to
not
wake
up
on
the
first
alarm.
Do
you
currently
consider
yourself
a
snoozer
using
this
definition?”,
as
adapted
from
[14].
For
snoozer
characteristics
analysis,
we
employed
the
Patient
Health
Questionnaire-2
(PHQ-2)
[59]
and
the
short
form
of
the
Pittsburgh
Sleep
Quality
Index
(PSQI)
[60],
averaging
the
values
collected
from
the
monthly
questionnaires.
Furthermore,
the
short
form
Positive
and
Negative
Affect
Schedule
(PANAS-SF)
[61]
was
gathered
at
the
initial
baseline
questionnaire.
Data
exclusion
and
Preprocessing
Sleep
data
were
restricted
to
the
time
range
from
July
1,
2021,
to
May
31,
2022,
due
to
our
rolling
recruitment
process
that
began
in
mid-June
2021
and
ended
in
June
2022,
in
order
to
exclude
months
where
data
was
not
collected
for
the
whole
month.
A
standard
filter,
adopted
from
[7],
was
applied
to
remove
outliers’
TSTs
(TST
<
3
and
TST
>
13).
Participants
with
less
than
30
nights
recorded
due
to
dropout
or
technical
issues
were
excluded.
For
gender-related
analysis,
non-binary
participants
(N=1)
were
excluded
to
preserve
their
privacy.
Statistical
Analysis
Linear
mixed
models
[34]
were
used
to
test
whether
sleep
patterns
and
their
regularity
changed
over
time
while
adjusting
for
demographics,
physical
activities,
season,
andpolicy
stringency.
Models
included
TST,
MS,
and
variability
of
TST
and
MS
as
dependent
variables.
We
adopt
a
sequential
modeling
strategy
in
which
we
sequentially
build
three
distinct
models
for
each
dependent
variable.
Model
1
consists
of
basic
characteristics
such
as
chronotype,
age,
gender,
origin,
occupation,
and
cohabitation
status.
Model
2
extends
Model
1
by
adjusting
for
external
factors
such
as
the
stringency
of
the
restrictions
and
day
length.
Finally,
Model
3
extends
Model
2
by
adding
physical
activity
metrics
using
the
number
of
step
count,
midstep,
and
step
entropy.

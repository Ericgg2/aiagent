Background:
The
COVID-19
pandemic
led
to
various
containment
strategies,
such
as
work-from-home
policies
and
reduced
social
contact,
which
significantly
altered
people's
sleep
routines.
While
previous
studies
have
highlighted
the
negative
impacts
of
these
restrictions
on
sleep,
they
often
overlook
a
comprehensive
perspective
that
incorporates
other
factors
that
can
also
influence
sleep,
such
as
seasonal
variations
and
physical
activity.
Objective:
Our
study
aims
to
longitudinally
examine
the
fine-grained
changes
in
sleep
patterns
of
working
adults
during
the
COVID-19
pandemic
using
a
combination
of
repeated
questionnaires
and
high-resolution
passive
measurements
from
wearable
sensors.
Weinvestigate
the
association
between
sleep
and
5
sets
of
variables
capturing
characteristics
of
individuals
including
(i)
demographics,
(ii)
sleep-related
habits,
(iii)
physical
activity
behaviors,
and
external
factors
including
(iv)
pandemic-specific
constraints,
and
(v)
seasonal
variations
during
the
study
period.
Methods:
We
recruited
working
adults
in
Finland
to
participate
in
our
one-year-long
study
(June
2021
-
June
2022)
conducted
in
the
late
stage
of
the
COVID-19
pandemic.
We
collected
multisensor
data
from
fitness
trackers
worn
by
the
participants
as
well
as
work
and
sleep-related
measures
through
monthly
questionnaires.
Additionally,
we
used
the
stringency
index
for
Finland
at
different
points
in
time
to
estimate
the
degree
of
the
pandemic-related
lockdown
restrictions
in
place
during
the
study
duration.
We
applied
linear
mixed
models
to
study
the
changes
in
sleep
patterns
during
the
late
stage
of
the
pandemic
and
their
association
with
the
aforementioned
five
sets
of
variables.
Results:
The
sleep
structure
of
27,350
nights
from
112
working
adults
was
analyzed.
We
observed
that
more
stringent
pandemic
measures
were
associated
with
longer
total
sleep
time
(TST)
(β=
0.02,
95%
CI
0.01
to
0.03,
P<.001)
and
later
midpoint
of
sleep
(MS)
(β=
0.1,
95%
CI
0.09
to
0.11,
P<.001).
Being
a
snoozer
(i.e.
snoozing
the
alarm
when
waking
up
from
sleep)
was
associated
with
higher
variability
in
both
TST
(β=
0.34,
95%
CI
0.13
to
0.54,
P=.002)
and
MS
(β=
0.24,
95%
CI
0.07
to
0.41,
P=.006).
Service
staff
slept
more
than
academic
staff
(β=
0.3,
95%
CI
0.09
to
0.51,
P=.005)
with
also
lower
variability
in
TST
(β=
-0.29,
95%
CI
-0.49
to
-0.08,
P=.006).
Engaging
in
physical
activity
earlier
in
the
day
correlated
with
longer
sleep
duration
(β=
0.06,
95%
CI
0.05
to
0.08,
P<.001).
Conclusions:
Our
study
provided
a
comprehensive
view
of
the
possible
factors
affecting
sleep
patterns
during
the
late
stage
of
the
pandemic.

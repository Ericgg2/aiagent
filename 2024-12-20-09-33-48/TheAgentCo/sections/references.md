Zhang Wei 
Male, 31 years old 
Senior Software Engineer (Streaming Database Team) 
Good morning! Which equipment do you need, 
and in what quantities? 
We require three desktop computers (HP 
WorkStation) and three wireless mice. 
Thank you for providing the details. However, the 
total cost comes to $4,704, which exceeds your 
department's budget. Could you please consider 
reducing the equipment request to align with the 
allocated budget? 
I understand the budget limitations so we can cut 
down on two mice and one desktop but not more 
than this because these are critical for our team 
to effectively work on RisingWave project. 
Thank you so much for understanding. I will 
update you once we confirm the order. Have a 
great day! 9:43 AM

Hi Ming, where can I find the job description template 
for the new grad database engineering position? 
The job description template for the new grad 
software engineering position is located on your local 
machine under the /instruction  directory with the 
filename template.md 
Thank you for the details. Also, what are the minimum 
and preferred qualifications? 
Minimum qualifications:

Degree in Computer Science, Information 
Systems, or related fields. 
2. Experience with SQL and at least one 
database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL). 
3. Knowledge of database design, normalization, 
and query optimization. 
Preferred qualifications: 
1. Internship experience in database 
development or administration. 
2. Familiarity with cloud databases (e.g., AWS 
RDS, Azure SQL). 
3. Strong problem-solving and troubleshooting 
skills. 
Thank you so much! Lastly, what is the ideal salary 
range? 9:50 AM

The salary range for the new grad database engineer 
position is between $120,000 and $150,000. If you 
have further questions, feel free to ask! 
11:34 AM 
Figure 6: Simulated Colleague Communication Example 2 – The agent is tasked with writing a

Figure 7: Simulated Colleague Communication Example 3 - The agent is tasked with scheduling a
meeting between NPCs Emily Zhou and Liu Qiang based on their availability. Emily is available on
Wednesday and Thursday, while Liu is only available on Thursday. The agent identifies Thursday
as the common free day and successfully proposes a mid-morning slot at 10:30 AM, which both
participants confirm. This example highlights the agent’s ability to manage multi-turn conversations,
effectively going back and forth between participants to align schedules and finalize a meeting time.

Fatigue is usually related to decreased physical activity or difficulty performing a task. Most sportspeople and laborers who perform intensive physical activities are often subjected to fatigue issues. The psychological state of the affected persons subjected to their sensations usually leads to perceived fatigue, which directly impacts the central nervous system and affects the mood [1]. Moreover, the central and peripheral contractions lead to performance fatigue, mainly related to muscle activation and contractile functions [2]. Monitoring such fatigue symptoms among highly active individuals is often challenging because they are busy with their professional tasks. In this regard, wearable devices could assist in observing their physical activities and log the data for analysis using AI frameworks. Currently, the most prominent related works can be observed in the literature. Lambay et al. [3] looked at machine learning techniques when looking at how to find physical fatigue in construction and manufacturing. They emphasized how hard it is to see fatigue and how important it is to have strong, all-around methods to keep an eye on and deal with fatigue in environments where people do the same thing repeatedly. Zong et al. [4] conducted a systematic review on fatigue in construction workers, identifying various causes and evaluation methods and emphasizing the importance of interventions to alleviate fatigue and improve occupational health and safety. Li et al. [5] introduced a decentralized approach for monitoring construction equipment operators' fatigue using facial images, highlighting the balance between technical efficiency and data privacy.

In the aviation industry, Ziakkas et al. [6] talked about the role of AI in fatigue risk management systems (FRMS). They said that FRMS could use data from wearable devices like EEGs and smartwatches to detect better and predict real-time fatigue, making flights safer and saving money. Similarly, the author in [7] provided further insights into AI-based strategies for detecting fatigue and sleep problems in aviation, emphasizing the advancements and challenges in using AI to enhance aviation safety by predicting fatigue-related incidents. Kong et al. [8] proposed a non-invasive method for fatigue detection using a multi-modal fusion of heart rate and facial features, achieving high accuracy in detecting driver fatigue and contributing to traffic safety.

Taylor et al. [9] demonstrated that a combination of wearable bracelets and RF sensing, analyzed through Random Forest and ResNet algorithms, achieved 100% accuracy in detecting fatigue. The bracelet alone also yielded high accuracy, highlighting the potential of hybrid sensing approaches in fatigue detection. Similarly, Biro et al. [10] used IMUs to track athletes' performance and employed AI to predict fatigue and stamina, achieving high predictive accuracy and facilitating individualized training adjustments to reduce the risk of overtraining. In [11], the authors

discussed how wearable biosensors can be used for non-invasive fatigue diagnosis. They also discussed the progress and problems of using biochemical reactions and data communication modules in biosensors. Alam et al. [12] suggested an activityaware recurrent neural network to measure cognitive and mental fatigue. This was much better than the current best methods. Goumopoulos et al. [13] used wearable devices for HRV analysis to detect mental fatigue, demonstrating high accuracy and potential for continuous, unobtrusive monitoring in everyday life. Lambert et al. [14] surveyed AI models for mental fatigue, highlighting the need for balanced parameter acquisition and model validation to improve accuracy and reliability. Lastly, Yaacob et al. [15] conducted a systematic review of AI techniques in brain-computer interfaces for mental fatigue detection, identifying research gaps and future directions for automated neurofeedback.

With the help of real datasets, Mu et al. [16] created a system for detecting fatigue based on ECG and HRV features. This system worked very well at monitoring exercise-induced fatigue in real-time. Similarly, Russell et al. [17] used a single sensor and a deep learning model to measure mental and physical fatigue during long-lasting mountain events. This shows that field fatigue research can be used in real life. Liu et al. [18] created a dynamic muscle fatigue classification model using sEMG and a better whale optimization algorithm. This model was very good at predicting muscle fatigue when conditions were changing.

Narteni et al. [19] looked into explainable AI (XAI) for predicting physical fatigue. They stressed how important it is for AI models used in the workplace to be trustworthy and easy to understand. Giorgi et al. [20] looked into neurophysiological parameters for assessing mental fatigue in self-driving cars and found sensitive indicators for real-time fatigue detection. Jiao et al. [21] looked into how HRV and EDA features could be used to detect driver fatigue. They were very good at capturing the body's responses to fatigue, which could improve driving and traffic safety.

El et al. [22] looked at machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods for finding driver fatigue. They discussed each method's usefulness and reliability and suggested areas for future research. Zhao et al. [23] proposed an rPPG-based learning fatigue detection system, demonstrating high accuracy in early fatigue detection using facial videos. Chang et al. [24] implemented a drowsiness-fatigue detection system using wearable smart glasses, significantly enhancing road safety by alerting drivers and following vehicles.

Liu et al. [25] developed ML models for detecting fatigue during repetitive physical tasks, achieving high accuracy and demonstrating the potential of wearable sensors in workplace safety. Finally, Maman et al. [26] proposed a data analytic framework for managing physical fatigue using wearable sensors, establishing feature and ML algorithm selection criteria to improve worker safety. The table in Appendix A.3 shows the summary of fatigue monitoring related works using AI frameworks.

#### *1.1. The Rise of AI and Wearables*

All fields of science and engineering, including the human factor, are currently experiencing a revolution due to the integration of AI technology. Both traditional ML methods (e.g., DT, SVM, RF) and advanced AI techniques such as deep learning and transformers are used to analyze vast amounts of multisource datasets, including images, time series, and demographic information. These techniques identify subtle patterns in the data, identify dependencies/relationships, and predict response variables. Figure 1 shows the representation of wearable technology that interacts with people and fatigue monitoring solutions powered by AI frameworks.

Additionally, AI is being used to improve the efficiency of systems and boost their accessibility. Integrating big data and AI's ability to process and analyze large amounts of data are key factors in this revolution, helping to make different systems and organizations more agile, efficient, and effective.

Also, wearable technology has been revolutionized in recent years. The availability, affordability, and unobtrusiveness of wearables have contributed to their popularity. Wearables like smartwatches and fitness trackers are becoming increasingly popular among consumers due to their ease of use and portability. They are now widely available and relatively inexpensive, making them accessible to many users. Moreover, these devices are typically passive, meaning they do not require active input from the user. They can automatically track movement, heart rate, sleep patterns, and other metrics, providing users with valuable insights about their health and wellness. Additionally, wearables are designed to be unobtrusive and worn throughout the day and night, allowing continuous monitoring. These factors have contributed to the rise of wearables, making them an increasingly popular choice for personal health and fitness tracking.

#### *1.2. Issues with Current Methods for Fatigue Monitoring*

There are several issues with the current methods and technologies used for fatigue monitoring. Self-reported fatigue can be unreliable as it relies on the individual's perception and subjective interpretation of the symptom. People may have different thresholds for what they consider "fatigue," and other elements like mood, motivation, and cognitive biases may also play a role. Additionally, people may under report or over-report their

fatigue levels due to social desirability bias, where they want to present themselves in a positive light. Furthermore, poor recall may affect self-reported fatigue, particularly if the individual is asked to report their fatigue levels retrospectively. Finally, self-reported fatigue may not always be accurate due to the complexity of the symptom, which various physical, psychological, and environmental factors can influence.

In addition to the issues related to self-reported fatigue, there are several other issues with monitoring fatigue. One of the major issues is the lack of a standard definition of fatigue, which makes it difficult to compare studies and results. Additionally, there is a lack of standardized and validated measures for fatigue, making it difficult to assess and monitor the symptoms accurately. Another problem is that there are numerous causes of fatigue, including illnesses, medications, lifestyle choices, and psychological factors, making it difficult to pinpoint the root cause.

Additionally, numerous physical, psychological, and environmental factors can affect fatigue, making it difficult to monitor with a single measurement or device. Furthermore, other elements like stress, physical activity, or sleep quality may impact physiological measures like heart rate, electroencephalogram, or actigraphy. Finally, monitoring fatigue in real-world settings outside of a laboratory can be challenging due to the need for continuous, discreet, and reliable data collection.

This work provides a comprehensive literature review of wearables and AI for fatigue monitoring. It covers various aspects of fatigue monitoring, such as the physiological signals used, the different types of wearables available, the methods used for data analysis, and the applications of fatigue monitoring in different industries. The literature review also looks at the current state of the technology, the challenges faced, and the future directions for the field. This work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of the research on fatigue monitoring using wearables and artificial intelligence and identify the gaps in the literature that need further research. Fatigue significantly impacts several industries, including construction, sports, aviation, healthcare, transportation, human health, and performance. Such fatigue may have negative impacts, resulting in accidents, injuries, and lower productivity. These effects include decreased awareness, diminished cognitive function, and decreased physical performance. The feasibility and efficacy of traditional fatigue detection techniques are limited because they frequently rely on subjective evaluations or intrusive procedures. These challenges may be partly resolved by combining wearable technology with AI, making it possible to assess weariness continuously, non-invasively, and in real-time.

Exploring patterns in multivariate time-series data is challenging due to the complexity, heterogeneity, and high dimensionality inherent in many environmental and urban datasets (Catley et al., 2008). These datasets often involve multiple interdependent variables measured over time, interacting in non-linear ways and across different time scales (Goswami, 2019). Temporal dependencies, varying trends, noise, missing data points, and irregular sampling intervals further complicate the identification of meaningful patterns, which may correspond to specific physical phenomena or events in real-world systems (Weerakody et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2020). To address these challenges, a range of AIdriven methods has been developed to enhance the classification and clustering of multivariate time-series data (Rojat et al., 2021). Traditional machine learning approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (Li, 2019) and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) (D'Urso et al., 2014), have been widely applied. More recently, advanced deep learning models have demonstrated significant capabilities. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) (Ienco and Interdonato, 2020; Wang et al., 2016) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks (Karim et al., 2019; Hong and Yoon, 2017) excel in capturing temporal dependencies, while Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) effectively identify spatial and temporal patterns (Liu et al., 2018; Tripathi and Baruah, 2020). Generative algorithms, particularly Transformer models (Liu et al., 2021; Zuo et al., 2023; Le et al., 2024; Zerveas et al., 2021), have emerged as powerful tools for modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data, making them highly suitable for multivariate time-series analysis (Zhou et al., 2021). Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are also gaining traction for their ability to handle missing data imputation and anomaly detection (Graving and Couzin, 2020; Lafabregue et al., 2022; Pham et al., 2022; Yokkampon et al., 2022). These deep generative models effectively learn data distributions in high-dimensional spaces by mapping them to lower-dimensional latent spaces, enabling more accurate and efficient analysis.

Despite advancements in AI-based methods, human-in-the-loop (HitL) approaches remain essential for interpreting and validating AI-generated insights (Kumar et al., 2024; Gomez-Carmona et al., 2024). Human expertise ensures ´ these patterns are relevant to specific domains, such as power system operations, where grid event data—often comprised of multivariate time-series recordings such as voltage, frequency, and current—requires careful interpretation to maintain reliable and efficient operations (Tocchetti and Brambilla, 2022; Wilson et al., 2024). These signatures often indicate system inefficiencies or disruptions, such as faults, generation/load imbalance, and inverter-induced oscillations, which can significantly impact grid reliability and stability if not addressed (Rivas and Abrao, 2020; Das, 2024). In addition, developing efficient AI-powered methods to uncover potential connections and interactions between different types of grid disturbances can enhance researchers' understanding of system complexity, enabling the development of more effective operational practices. While AI can detect these disturbances, human involvement is critical for contextualizing and applying these insights in real-world urban power system operations. This interplay highlights the importance of explainable AI (XAI) methods, which enhance transparency and empower operators to act confidently on AI-generated insights (Nallakaruppan et al., 2024). Visual analytics further strengthens human-AI collaboration by enabling intuitive understanding of deep learning models through interactive visualizations, emphasizing the need to integrate visual analytics into XAI methodologies (Niloofar et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024).

Addressing the challenges of analyzing complex patterns in multivariate time series data requires innovative approaches that bridge the gap between advanced deep learning models and interpretability. This paper introduces a visual analytics framework that reduces and represents these patterns in lower-dimensional latent spaces using the Time Fusion Transformer (TFT) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) approaches. Dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP are employed to visualize these representations in 2D as latent vector maps, enabling intuitive exploration of data patterns. Distance metrics are used to uncover correlations and topological relationships between patterns, enhancing the interpretability of generative models for exploratory fault pattern analysis. To ensure robust and efficient performance, the framework integrates evaluation metrics and advanced visualizations, enabling comparative analysis and validation of TFT- and VAE-based methods through domain knowledge. These tools facilitate parameter tuning, improving model reliability and scalability.

A case study on power grid signal data demonstrates the framework's ability to identify grid event signatures—distinctive patterns associated with faults and abnormal behaviors such as capacitor switching, load shedding, and inverter malfunctions, to name a few—while revealing potential connections between these events. In the case study, the performance of both TFT and VAE-based methods was evaluated under varying configurations, including latent vector dimensions (e.g., 8, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 640) and different dimensionality reduction algorithms. Two VAE-based methods were developed: one using 1D convolutional layers and the other leveraging LSTM for encoding multivariate time series data. Three validation methods are employed to assess the outputs of different models: internal validation metrics, a Human-in-the-Loop approach, and a relative validation technique that involves comparing outputs from various models using corresponding plots and shape-matching methods. The comparative analysis showed a consistency of 86–92% between the 2D latent vector representations produced by TFT and the VAE-based methods under optimized model configurations and dimension reduction algorithms (e.g., t-SNE), and revealed that TFT outperforms VAE in run-time and scalability for diverse data shapes. By integrating TFT with visual analytics, this work advances fault diagnosis in multivariate time series data, fostering explainable AI approaches that improve decision-making in critical system operations.

## 2. Literature Review

Analyzing patterns in multivariate time-series data, characterized by high dimensionality and complexity, requires interdisciplinary approaches to support effective decision-making. This literature review is structured into four sections. First, it identifies research needs for multivariate pattern analysis in urban and environmental studies. Second, it examines applications in power grid operations, where inherently multivariate data from diverse sensors provide practical use cases for disturbance diagnosis and pattern analysis. Third, it reviews AI and Human-in-the-Loop (HitL) methods for dimensionality reduction, enabling visual exploration and interpretation of complex datasets. Finally, it addresses challenges in current applications, emphasizing limitations in supporting experts with complex multivariate time-series data. Using power grid signal data as a case study, this review identifies knowledge gaps and drives advancements in fault diagnosis and multivariate pattern analysis.

## *2.1. Multivariate Pattern Detection and Exploration in Broad Urban Management Applications*

Exploring multivariate patterns in urban and environmental data, often surrogates for underlying physical processes, is crucial for managing smart city systems. This approach supports hypothesis generation, anomaly detection, and fault diagnosis (Erhan et al., 2021; Sarker, 2022). By analyzing spatial and temporal variability across environmental attributes, infrastructure features, and urban characteristics, urban planners and environmental scientists can uncover insights into complex, interconnected systems such as transportation (Berres et al., 2021a; Pack, 2010; Berres et al., 2021b), building energy (Xu et al., 2022b; Cottafava et al., 2018), public health (Xu et al., 2021; Preim and Lawonn, 2020), and watershed management (Xu et al., 2022a, 2020). These insights drive the development of holistic management practices, enhancing the sustainability, resilience, and efficiency of urban environments (Bibri, 2021).

To emphasize the importance of interpreting multivariate data patterns, we review notable studies in environmental and urban management. Xu et al. (2019) developed a web-based geovisual analytics platform leveraging machine learning and visual analytics to address culvert sedimentation, a key infrastructure issue in watershed management. The platform integrates diverse data sources and uses a tree-based feature selection algorithm and self-organizing maps (SOMs) to identify sedimentation drivers, visualize multivariate patterns, and inform mitigation strategies. This scalable, explainable AI tool is adaptable to broader environmental challenges. In the transportation sector, Dadashova et al. (2021) used multivariate time series analysis to explore how socioeconomic factors impact urban traffic congestion. Using data from 51 U.S. metropolitan areas, they incorporated variables such as employment rates and fuel prices into vector autoregressive models with exogenous factors (VAR-X). These models provided interpretable insights for forecasting congestion metrics and informing targeted, data-driven management strategies. Sanhudo et al. (2021) applied machine learning to improve building energy management through clustering and regression techniques. By using k-medoids clustering and dynamic time warping to enhance weather data quality, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) to rectify errors, the study demonstrated significant potential for energy optimization. However, limited explainability of these models restricts deeper insights into underlying patterns. Finally, Hsieh (2004) extended classical techniques like PCA and CCA to nonlinear variants (NLPCA and NLCCA) using neural networks. Applied to climate and oceanographic data, these methods revealed intricate patterns in complex systems such as El Nino, o ˜ ffering valuable tools for managing multivariate data in smart grid systems and other resilient infrastructure applications.

Based on these example studies, it can be concluded that in various fields of urban and environmental studies, analyzing multivariate spatial and time-series data supports researchers and decision-makers in several key ways:

- Perform Dimensionality reduction to group features based on multivariate similarities, facilitating the clustering of complex data. This approach aids in identifying environmental or urban phenomena by analyzing specific attributes of one or more data features (Xu et al., 2020; Sanhudo et al., 2021).
Explore Dependencies among time series of multiple variables to enable causal inference, providing insights into the underlying physical processes represented by these data variables (Dadashova et al., 2021).

By analyzing surrogate data to understand environmental or urban phenomena and the interdependencies between physical processes, researchers can derive insights to inform effective management practices. This approach facilitates the promotion or mitigation of specific phenomena and their underlying processes, reducing potential hazards and faults in urban systems.

# *2.2. Multivariate Pattern Detection and Exploration in Grid Operations*

As a critical urban subsystem, smart grids generate vast amounts of multivariate time-series data from various devices and sensors (Syed et al., 2020). Smart meters at consumer sites record variables such as power consumption, voltage, and frequency, offering insights into energy usage patterns (Wang et al., 2020). Digital Fault Recorders (DFRs) capture high-frequency recordings of disturbances, namely faults, on the order of microseconds, typically capturing point-on-wave (PoW) voltages and currents at various points in a distribution system. Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) at substations typically stream measurements such as voltage, current, frequency, and phase angle, enabling real-time stability monitoring(Biswal et al., 2023). SCADA systems aggregate data from Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) and Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) across substations, continuously monitoring grid health through variables like voltage, current, power flow, and equipment status (Manoj, 2021), though they report readings on the order of seconds rather then milliseconds, in the case of PMUs, or microseconds in the case of DFRs. Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), including solar and wind energy systems, provide data on generation levels, voltage, and frequency, which are critical for renewable energy integration. Environmental sensors add weatherrelated data—temperature, humidity, and wind speed—essential for predicting energy demand and supply (Nyangon, 2024). Together, these data streams enable comprehensive grid analysis and control.

In the past decades, advanced time-series classification methods have been adopted into many power grids as a critical component of their monitoring and controls systems to facilitate anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and control purposes (Susto et al., 2018). For instance, Ceci et al. (2020) introduces ECHAD (Embedding-based CHAnge Detection), an unsupervised machine learning method for detecting shifts in multivariate time-series data, such as energy metrics. ECHAD adapts dynamically to real-time patterns, improving resilience to collinearity and noise while monitoring renewable energy fluctuations and power loads. Although robust, its reliance on embeddings and one-class learning limits explainability. Similarly, Pinzon and Colom ´ e (2019) proposes a Random Forest (RF)-based method ´ for short-term voltage stability (STVS) assessment using PMU data. By classifying voltage states under disturbances like fast voltage collapses, the model provides interpretable alerts, aiding real-time decision-making. However, its reliance on predefined labels restricts its adaptability to new, unlabeled patterns. Alaca et al. (2024) introduce a twostep phase fault classification method for analyzing power grid data using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The first step involves fault detection, determining if a fault exists in the signal, while the second step identifies fault types, such as single-line-to-ground or line-to-line faults. Various feature extraction techniques, including amplitude and phase (AP), fast Fourier transform (FFT), wavelet transform (WT), and power spectral density (PSD), were explored to optimize performance. The study demonstrates that combinations like AP-AP and FFT-WT yield the highest accuracy. Simulation and real-world tests validate the method's superiority over conventional one-step classification, highlighting its potential for real-time fault analysis in smart grid systems. (Bakdi et al., 2021) introduces a novel data-driven methodology for analyzing multivariate time series data in grid-connected photovoltaic (GPV) systems. It employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and decorrelation, followed by Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) to detect anomalies. Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) refines the density estimation of transformed components (TCs) derived from PCA, enabling nonparametric and adaptive fault detection. This approach overcomes limitations of Gaussian assumptions, computational complexity, and parametric constraints. The methodology is validated through extensive experiments with real-world faults under Maximum and Intermediate Power Point Tracking (MPPT/IPPT) modes, demonstrating improved detection sensitivity, computational efficiency, and robustness to varying environmental conditions. Despite its high accuracy, both the methods are primarily designed to classify phase faults, rather than enabling an interactive ways to help domain experts explore and analyze different types of faults, and their potential connections.

Multivariate temporal pattern analysis in grid operation sectors often focuses on detecting data anomalies in continuous streams from devices such as Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) and smart meters to extract operational insights and support decision-making. These analyses aim to enhance Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI), Predictive Maintenance, and Cybersecurity in grid management (Susto et al., 2018). Practical grid management faces several challenges that include heterogeneous data sources, nonstationary signals, computational complexity, scalability, and missing data. These challenges call for scalable, generative AI-powered methods capable of handling diverse grid time-series data efficiently to enable real-time, actionable insights for grid operations.

# *2.3. Latent Space Cartography and Visual Analytics*

Deep generative models serve as universal tools for learning data distributions in high-dimensional spaces by mapping them to lower-dimensional latent spaces, enabling efficient representation and synthesis of complex data patterns (Frenzel et al., 2019). To increase the explainability and interprebility of these deep generative models and their outputs, a few recent studies have provided methodologies to visualize the latent representations of the complex high-dimension data. The latent representation is a compressed, lower-dimensional encoding of input data that is produced by generative AI models captures its essential features and structures while discarding irrelevant details, it can carry valuable information to help researcher explains how the AI models proceeds the complex data and produce the analytical outputs, such as clusters and classifications. Methodologies presented through these studies are often known as the "Latent Space Cartography" and "Latent Space Visual Analytics" Liu et al. (2019); Kwon et al. (2023), and have been developed to help users extract and analyze patterns in various types of data, emphasizing the interpretability and practical utility of latent spaces in diverse domains.

As examples, Frenzel et al. (2019) proposed metric-based transformations designed to improve the geometric

structure of latent spaces generated by deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Their approach targets a significant gap in ensuring that latent space distances accurately represent semantic relationships, particularly in high-dimensional, non-Euclidean data like those encountered in natural language processing. This method enables enhanced clustering and interpolation, which are critical for applications such as language modeling and feature synthesis. Liu et al. (2019) developed the concept of "Latent Space Cartography", an integrated visual analytics framework that facilitates tasks such as analogy construction, semantic dimension mapping, and latent space comparison. Designed for diverse datasets, including emojis, word embeddings, and biological features, their system employs user-defined semantic axes and advanced projection strategies, such as t-SNE and PCA, to uncover nuanced relationships within the data. By enabling interactive exploration, it bridges the gap between static visualizations and actionable insights, making it particularly valuable for scientific feature analysis and machine learning evaluation. Kwon et al. (2023) introduced the "Latent Space Explorer", a multimodal visualization tool tailored for datasets such as cardiac MRIs and ECGs. This system provides a comprehensive workflow that integrates subgroup exploration, interactive decoding, and phenotype prediction accuracy analysis. By addressing the challenges of multimodal latent representation, the tool supports domain experts in uncovering subgroup-specific correlations and testing biases, thus enhancing clinical applications in cardiovascular health. O'Mahony et al. (2022) further extended the latent space visualization paradigm by incorporating non-Euclidean geometries and multi-task metric learning to disentangle complex subgroup features in dynamic systems. Their methodology uses cartographic techniques to display latent spaces as two-dimensional visualizations, enabling users to examine patterns, correlations, and subgroup behaviors within fine-grained datasets. Applications include biological processes, where latent spaces reveal dynamic relationships affected by temporal or environmental factors, and physical systems, where domain knowledge informs geometric transformations for more robust interpretability.

These methodologies address key challenges in latent space analysis, such as enhancing interpretability, preserving geometric coherence, and accommodating specific data modalities. By emphasizing tailored visualization tools, they enable meaningful insights from complex data, driving advancements in AI-powered exploratory analysis across scientific, medical, and industrial fields.

# *2.4. Knowledge Gaps and Motivation*

While existing methodologies in latent space cartography are valuable, they can benefit from further refinement. By integrating more advanced visual analytics techniques, such as sophisticated user interactions, enhanced analytical reasoning, and tailored visual encoding, these applications can be improved to handle more complex real-world urban data. Such enhancements would foster greater data interpretability and model explainability, supporting practical training, education, and decision-making in urban system management and operations. In the context of facilitating multivariate temporal pattern explorations to support piratical urban applications, such as the fault diagnosis in power grid data, the existing methods face the following limitations:

KG1. Lacking Efficient Methods for Multivariate Time-series Analysis: Most existing studies employ GAN, VAE,

and sentence transformer to analyze semantic data, text data, image data, and single variate time-series data. VAE and GAN are not proven to be computational efficient for analyzing complex multivariate time-series analysis Studies that utilize dedicated

- KG2. Limited Scalability and Adaptibility to Varying Data Shapes: The length and number of features in timeseries data collected from various sensors across urban systems can vary significantly. Existing methods that rely on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to derive latent vectors often lack scalability and generalizability for datasets with diverse shapes. These approaches frequently require substantial modifications to the AI models to adapt to differing dataset dimensions, posing challenges for efficient and flexible implementation.
- KG3. Limited Visual Analytical Reasoning for Complex Data: Most existing latent space cartography studies rely on simple 2D scatter plots with color coding to visualize the distribution of complex data after dimensionality reduction. However, this approach has significant limitations when it comes to representing data with multiple labels or diverse characteristics. The 2D color-coded point representation is inherently constrained, as it can visually encode only a very limited number of data features. Consequently, it fails to effectively capture and represent multi-faceted datasets, such as ensemble or multi-label data.

Given these challenges and knowledge gaps, we are motivated to develop a visual analytical framework that leverages the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)—a state-of-the-art generative AI model based on the transformer architecture for temporal data analytics—along with advanced visual analytics techniques. Our approach seeks to facilitate the extraction and exploration of multivariate temporal patterns in complex urban data. By harnessing the TFT's high efficiency, scalability, and adaptability for handling time-series data, we aim to address knowledge gaps KG 1 and KG 2. Through the design and experimentation of advanced visual analytics techniques, such as novel visual encodings and interactive user interfaces, we propose a comprehensive visual analytical workflow. This workflow will enable the effective visualization of complex latent vectors (embeddings) generated by the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), including ensemble and multi-label data. By providing deeper insights into complex patterns, our proposed framework seeks to significantly enhance pattern exploration and interpretation in urban data systems, addressing knowledge gap KG 3.

To evaluate the performance and accuracy of the TFT-based method, we implemented two VAE-based models—one utilizing a 1D convolution layer and the other employing an LSTM as the encoder—to validate the outputs generated by the TFT. Alongside this task, we developed an evaluation workflow that incorporates novel metrics and ensemble visualizations to comprehensively compare multiple aspects of the TFT and VAE-based methods.

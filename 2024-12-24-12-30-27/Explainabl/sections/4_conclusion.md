In this study, we introduced a comprehensive framework that combines advanced generative AI models, namely the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), with robust visual analytics to facilitate the exploration and interpretation of complex multivariate time-series data. By leveraging dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP, our framework enables the visualization of latent space representations, offering domain experts intuitive insights into clustering patterns and temporal dependencies. Through case studies utilizing real-world power grid data, we demonstrated the framework's ability to uncover interdependencies among fault events, enhance the imputation of missing class labels, and provide actionable guidance for model parameter tuning.

The results underscore the scalability and efficiency of the TFT model for diverse time-series data shapes, outperforming VAE-based approaches in runtime while maintaining robust analytical capabilities. Moreover, the interactive visual analytics interface significantly enhances human-AI collaboration, enabling domain experts to validate and refine clustering outcomes through human-in-the-loop and relative validation techniques.

Despite its strengths, the framework has limitations, including challenges in visualizing multi-label data with numerous categorical combinations and the absence of comprehensive ground truth datasets for external validation. Future work will address these limitations by developing advanced visual encoding techniques for multi-label data and incorporating external validation mechanisms to further validate clustering reliability.

By bridging the gap between complex data-driven AI techniques and interpretability, this framework advances explainable AI for multivariate time-series analysis, paving the way for more reliable and actionable insights in critical domains such as power grid management and beyond.

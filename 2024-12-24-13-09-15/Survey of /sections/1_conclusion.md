Advancement of multimodal learning relies on development of specialized datasets, which we have grouped into three main categories: training needs, task-specific needs, and domain-specific needs. Training datasets, which are vital for pretraining and instruction tuning methods such as SFT and RLHF, act as the backbone for building and refining multimodal systems.The second category includes needs that are task-specific: these are datasets built for specific tasks that make a model perform well for narrow applications. Finally, domain-specific datasets are essential for solving the peculiarities of specific industries and making the model adaptable and context-sensitive. Although challenges are still there, such as data diversity and effective cross-modal integration, emerging trends in data augmentation and cross-modal learning are mellowing these challenges. Therefore, the development and diversification of these categories of datasets will be highly essential to unlocking the potentials of multimodal systems and further innovations in AI.

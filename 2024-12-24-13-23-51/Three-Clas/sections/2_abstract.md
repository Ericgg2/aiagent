Sentiment analysis is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP) and has widespread applications in areas such as public opinion monitoring and market research. This paper proposes a three-class sentiment analysis method based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, aiming to analyze the sentiment polarity (positive, neutral, negative) of Weibo comment texts. As a deep learning model, LSTM is capable of effectively handling long-distance dependencies in text, offering advantages over traditional machine learning models. By preprocessing and learning features from Weibo comment texts, the LSTM model can accurately predict the sentiment category of the comments. Experimental results show that the LSTM model performs excellently in the sentiment analysis task for Weibo comments, with an accuracy of 98.31% and an F1 score of 98.28%, far surpassing traditional models and other deep learning approaches. This demonstrates that LSTM can better capture the sentiment information in text, significantly improving the accuracy of sentiment classification. However, the LSTM model still has some limitations, such as high computational complexity and slower processing of long texts. Additionally, complex emotional expressions like sarcasm and humor may affect the model's performance. In the future, combining pre-trained models or improving feature engineering may further enhance the accuracy and practicality of the model. Overall, the LSTM model provides an effective solution for sentiment analysis of Weibo comments.[1] *Keywords:* Sentiment Classification; Natural Language Processing; LSTM; Deep Learning; Machine Learning.

The output layer feeds the feature vectors produced by the LSTM model into a fully connected layer for dimensionality reduction. The fully connected layer then outputs the sentiment label categories, thereby completing the sentiment classification task. Finally, the Softmax function is utilized to normalize the outputs, resulting in the predicted sentiment polarity for the review texts.

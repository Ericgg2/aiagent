The input layer of the LSTM model is responsible for converting raw text data into numerical vector representations that can be processed by the subsequent network layers. The design of the input layer involves three key steps: text preprocessing, word embedding representation, and input sequence construction.

Text Preprocessing: Raw text data undergoes tokenization, dividing it into individual words or subword units. Stopwords, special symbols, and redundant characters are removed to ensure the purity of the text data. Tokenized texts are then indexed, converting them into integer indices according to a vocabulary list.

Word Embedding Representation: Word Embedding technology, such as Word2Vec, GloVe, or randomly initialized embedding layers, maps the text data into continuous vector representations of fixed dimensions. Each input word is mapped into a low-dimensional word vector space where word vectors can capture semantic relationships and similarities between words. An embedding layer converts the indexed words into a word vector matrix with the shape (batch size, sequence length, embedding dim).

Input Sequence Construction: Text data is standardized to a uniform length by setting sequence length, padding shorter texts, and truncating longer ones. After passing through the embedding layer, the input text sequences form tensors of shape batch size,sequence length,embedding dim, which serve as inputs to the LSTM layer. Through the input layer's processing, raw text data is efficiently converted into numerical sequence representations suitable for LSTM network modeling, providing a foundation for capturing sequence features.

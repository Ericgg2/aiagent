Traditional machine learning methods learn and extract text features through algorithms to determine the sentiment polarity of the text. These methods effectively avoid some of the drawbacks of sentiment dictionary-based approaches and have strong adaptability. Commonly used machine learning algorithms include Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest, among others. In research, a multimodal joint sentiment topic model based on Weibo data (MJST) introduces emojis and user personality features. It analyzes users' hidden emotional characteristics and sentiment topic features using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, which significantly improves the performance of unsupervised learning compared to traditional methods. Additionally, some studies have applied TF-IDF feature selection combined with the SVM model for sentiment classification of Tibetan corpus, enriching the research on Tibetan sentiment analysis. Although traditional machine learning methods outperform sentiment dictionary approaches in terms of performance, they suffer from poor transferability and high dependence on domain knowledge and manual labeling. With the development of deep learning technologies, sentiment analysis has gradually shifted towards deep learning methods.[4, 5]

This paper thoroughly examines the application of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models in Chinese sentiment analysis. Experimental results show that by capturing the contextual information of samples, the LSTM model significantly enhances the performance of sentiment classification. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms various classical traditional machine learning models, thereby validating its effectiveness and feasibility to some extent.

Future research can further address ambiguous comments. Specifically, for comments that contain multiple emotions, a multi-label classification approach can be employed to describe the complex emotional composition within these comments. By integrating contextual information, this method can better understand the different emotional contexts, thereby improving model performance and enhancing its generalization capability.

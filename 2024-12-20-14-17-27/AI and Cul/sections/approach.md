whether
models
can
correctly
guess
answers
without
seeing
the
actual
questions.
The
expected
range
for
random
guessing
was
between
13.8%
and
26.3%,
with
a
theoretical
mean
of
19.9%.
In
our
testing,
all
models
fell
outside
this
expected
guessing
range.
The
top-performing
models
were
Claude
and
Qwen,
both
achieving
37.5%,
followed
closely
by
Ernie
at
36.9%.
While
these
scores
exceeded
chance
levels,
they
were
significantly
lower
than
ChatGPT's

rate

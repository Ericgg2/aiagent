Our
analysis
reveals
the
promise
and
limitations
of
current
LLMs
in
cross-cultural
social
work
contexts.
While
Chinese
and
Western
models
demonstrated
sufficient
competency
to
pass
examination
standards,
their
performance
exposed
notable
limitations
in
handling
nuanced
content.
The
emergence
of
advanced
reasoning
models
like
DeepThink
suggests
promising
directions
forward,
particularly
in
addressing
the
sequential
prediction
limitations
of
traditional
LLMs.
However,
even
these
more29
sophisticated
models
display
inconsistencies
that
reinforce
the
continued
importance
of
human
oversight
in
professional
applications.
By
positioning
AI
as
a
knowledge
delivery
tool
rather
than
an
autonomous
practitioner ,
we
can
develop
systems
that
genuinely
enhance
professional
practice
while
preserving
the
essential
human
elements
of
social
work.
Our
study
demonstrates
these
models'
facility
with
foundational
social
work
knowledge;
the
next
step
is
leveraging
this
capability
to
create
thoughtfully
designed
support
systems
that
help
practitioners
better
serve
their
clients.30
